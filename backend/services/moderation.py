üõ°Ô∏è moderation.py ‚Äî ECOD Comment Filter

This module provides basic moderation logic for ECOD‚Äôs participatory threads.
It currently uses a keyword-based stub to flag potentially toxic or disruptive
comments, and is designed to be replaced with a more robust ML model such as
Detoxify or a custom transformer pipeline.

üîß Core Function:
- `moderate_comment(text)`:
  Scans incoming comment text for flagged keywords (e.g., "panic", "scam").
  Returns a status of `"flagged"` or `"approved"` with matched terms.

üß† Strategic Role:
- Supports ECOD‚Äôs **moderation principle** by filtering out harmful or distracting content.
- Enables **constructive engagement** by keeping threads focused and civil.
- Designed for future expansion into ML-based moderation with explainable outputs.

This stub ensures basic safety while allowing rapid iteration. It can be swapped
for a model-based filter without disrupting the API contract or backend flow.
